When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you want to share a project between users or between computers. Or for remote backup.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Doing a pull could potentially overwrite some local files that you have been working on but haven't committed yet.
	Also you may want to wait for particular set of commits on the remote to be completed before merging with your own.
